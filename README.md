# Face Emotion Recognition 🎭

A full‑stack web application that detects human emotions in faces using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the [FER‑2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) dataset.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Real‑time Emotion Detection**  
  Capture from webcam or upload an image to classify one of seven emotions:  
  `Angry`, `Disgust`, `Fear`, `Happy`, `Sad`, `Surprise`, `Neutral`.

- **Pre‑trained CNN Model**  
  Keras/TensorFlow model (`model_weights.h5`) fine‑tuned on FER‑2013.

- **Interactive Frontend**  
  JavaScript & CSS client for live preview, emotion overlay, and responsive design.

- **RESTful API Backend**  
  Flask‑based `app.py` exposes `/predict` endpoint for image inference.

- **Exploratory Notebook**  
  Jupyter notebook for data exploration, model architecture, training history, and performance metrics.
